# Security+ Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and study materials while preparing for the **CompTIA Security+ SY0-701** certification.

## 📘 Organization Method
The structure of these notes follows the learning flow from the  
**“Get Certified Get Ahead – CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Study Guide” by Gibson & Shelley**.

I chose to organize my notes according to this book rather than the standard CompTIA domain order because it provides:
- A clearer progression of concepts
- Better topic grouping
- More logical sequencing for beginners
- Stronger reinforcement through practical examples

## 📂 Topics Covered (Book-Aligned Structure)

- Mastering Security Basics  
- Understanding Identity and Access Management  
- Exploring Network Technologies and Tools  
- Securing Your Network  
- Securing Hosts and Data  
- Comparing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Common Attacks  
- Protecting Against Advanced Attacks  
- Using Risk Management Tools  
- Implementing Controls to Protect Assets  
- Understanding Cryptography and PKI  
- Implementing Policies to Mitigate Risks  

I’m documenting my journey and creating concise notes to reinforce my understanding and to help others studying for Security+.
